 --A notepad of ideas on where this project is going -- 

- generate name (done)

- make other py script
- this script gets the name of the institution -
- find definitions of noun and adj used. 
- generate field of interest (get related words?)

- maybe mine google scholar for paper titles?

- The history of the institution - not over years but over seconds (with same output)
- generate organs such as:
## head of, expert on, 
# research, communication, archive, production, presentation, exhibitions, evening programme,

Currently reading about a relevant sci-fi script generator, and how it "exists somewhere in between author and tool, writer and regurgitator."  It consequently identifies (and 'trains' its creators about) tired tropes in sci-fi.  

 "A funhouse mirror to hold up to various bodies of cultural content and reflect what they are."
